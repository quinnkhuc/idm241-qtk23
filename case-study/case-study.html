    <h1>The Body Shop</h1>
    <h2>The Overview</h2>
    <p>The purpose of this project is identifying an existing micro-interaction on any website and improving upon it. Therefore, the add to cart process of The Body Shop e-commerce was targeted, and the reason for that is that, oftentimes, the add item to cart process on e-commerce sites is bland, boring, and does not spark joy. The same case goes to the add to cart process on The Body Shop e-commerce site. In order to make this process more meaningful and enjoyable, multiple different micro-interactions were added to the add to cart button over the course of 10 weeks.</p>
    <h2>Context and Challenge</h2>
    <p>The timeline for this project is 10 weeks, with the project being broken down to 3 different stages, alpha, beta, and final. The goal of this project is to bring joy to the customers whenever they decide to add an item to their shopping cart. And if positive feedbacks are received from the users when they interact with the add to cart button, the project is considered to be a success. One of the main challenges for this project was creating meaningful micro-interactions. Although there are a lot of micro-interaction samples out there, identifying a suitable micro-interaction for the project that was also meaningful and sparked joy was proven to be more challenging than I expected.</p>
    <h2>Process and Insight</h2>
    <p>Since this project is focusing on improving existing micro-interaction on The Body Shop e-commerce site, it is not necessary to rebrand the whole project. Therefore, this project from start to finish utilized the existing design and branding of The Body Shop e-commerce site. In order to come up with meaningful and enjoyable interaction, a research process was necessary. The first step of the research process was to identify the problems with the add to cart process on The Body Shop e-commerce site. After the problems are identified, the next step was to look for inspiration on how to improve it. Then, based on the inspiration gathered, the first draft of the process, or the alpha design, was created using Figma and Adobe After Effects. After getting some feedback on the alpha design, the alpha designed is coded into an alpha build where user could now interact with the add to cart button. As the alpha build got approved, the beta stage kicked in. For the beta stage, more micro-interactions were added to the existing alpha product. The beta stage went through the exact same process as the alpha stage, and after the beta build got approved, the final stage kicked in, where even more complicated micro-interactions were added. As the final design got approved, the final build was developed to deliver the experience of the add to cart process.</p>

    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>The current the add to cart button on The Body Shop e-commerce site only changes it color whenever the user hovers over it. As stated in the previous section, this process is bland, boring, and does not spark joy. To make the process more interesting, instead of just changing the font and background color of the button, a cart icon is added next to the add to cart text whenever the user hovers over the button.</p>

    <p>Another problem with the add to cart process on the current The Body Shop e-commerce site is that if the user wants to add an item to cart, they have to click on add to cart button, select the number of items they want to add, and then click add to cart button again. This is unnecessary and time-consuming. To streamline the process, this 3-step process is cut down to 2, where the user only needs to click on add to cart button once and select the number of items they want to add once.</p>

    <p>And finally, on the current The Body Shop e-commerce site, whenever the user finishes adding their wanted item to cart, nothing happens except the model closes and the number next to the cart icon gets updated. Again, to make this process more pleasant, an animation of the product flying to cart is added to give user a visual representation of what they just did.</p>

    <h2>Result</h2>
    <p id="final-paragraph">10 weeks were more than sufficient to deliver an improved and enjoyable add to cart process for The Body Shop e-commerce site. The project is considered to be a success because most of the feedbacks for the add to cart process are positive. In the future, if possible, I would like to expand my project into other micro-interaction available on The Body Shop e-commerce site other than just focusing on only the add to cart process.</p>
